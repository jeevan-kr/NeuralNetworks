    "In my opinion, the best way to think of Neural Networks is as real-valued circuits, where real values (instead of boolean values {0,1}) “flow” along edges and interact in gates. However, instead of gates such as AND, OR, NOT, etc, we have binary gates such as * (multiply), + (add), max or unary gates such as exp, etc. Unlike ordinary boolean circuits, however, we will eventually also have gradients flowing on the same edges of the circuit, but in the opposite direction. But we’re getting ahead of ourselves. Let’s focus and start out simple.\n",

Thinking through it, we can intuit that the force on x should also be positive, because making x slightly larger improves the circuit’s output. For example, increasing x from `x = -2` to `x = -1` would give us output -3 - much larger than -6. On the other hand, we’d expect a negative force induced on y that pushes it to become lower (since a lower y, such as `y = 2`, down from the original `y = 3` would make output higher: 2 `x -2 = -4`, again, larger than -6). That’s the intuition to keep in mind, anyway. As we go through this, it will turn out that forces I’m describing will in fact turn out to be the derivative of the output value with respect to its inputs (x and y).

We will work backwards: Instead of pulling on the circuit’s output, we’ll iterate over every input one by one, increase it very slightly and look at what happens to the output value. The amount the output changes in response is the derivative. Enough intuitions for now. Lets look at the mathematical definition.

I know it’s confusing but it’s standard notation. Anyway, I hope it doesn’t look too scary because it isn’t: The circuit was giving some initial output $f(x,y)$, and then we changed one of the inputs by a tiny amount $h$ and read the new output $f(x+h,y)$. Subtracting those two quantities tells us the change, and the division by $h$ just normalizes this change by the (arbitrary) tweak amount we used.

The division by h is there to normalize the circuit’s response by the (arbitrary) value of h we chose to use here. Technically, you want the value of h to be infinitesimal (the precise mathematical definition of the gradient is defined as the limit of the expression as h goes to zero), but in practice h=0.00001 or so works fine in most cases to get a good approximation.

    "As expected, we changed the inputs by the gradient and the circuit now gives a slightly higher value (-5.87 > -6.0). That was much simpler than trying random changes to x and y, right? A fact to appreciate here is that if you take calculus you can prove that the gradient is, in fact, the direction of the steepest increase of the function. There is no need to monkey around trying out random pertubations as done in Strategy #1. Evaluating the gradient requires just three evaluations of the forward pass of our circuit instead of hundreds, and gives the best tug you can hope for (locally) if you are interested in increasing the value of the output.\n",

    "Bigger step is not always better. Let me clarify on this point a bit. It is important to note that in this very simple example, using a bigger step_size than 0.01 will always work better. For example, step_size = 1.0 gives output -1 (higer, better!), and indeed infinite step size would give infinitely good results. The crucial thing to realize is that once our circuits get much more complex (e.g. entire neural networks), the function from inputs to the output value will be more chaotic and wiggly. The gradient guarantees that if you have a very small (indeed, infinitesimally small) step size, then you will definitely get a higher number when you follow its direction, and for that infinitesimally small step size there is no other direction that would have worked better. But if you use a bigger step size (e.g. step_size = 0.01) all bets are off. The reason we can get away with a larger step size than infinitesimally small is that our functions are usually relatively smooth. But really, we’re crossing our fingers and hoping for the best.\n",

We can sense the steepness of the hill at our feet (the gradient), so when we shuffle our feet a bit we will go upwards. But if we took a big, overconfident step, we could have stepped right into a hole.\n",

    "In the previous section we evaluated the gradient by probing the circuit’s output value, independently for every input. This procedure gives you what we call a numerical gradient. This approach, however, is still expensive because we need to compute the circuit’s output as we tweak every input value independently a small amount. So the complexity of evaluating the gradient is linear in number of inputs. But in practice we will have hundreds, thousands or (for neural networks) even tens to hundreds of millions of inputs, and the circuits aren’t just one multiply gate but huge expressions that can be expensive to compute. We need something better.\n",

We call this an analytic gradient and there will be no need for tweaking anything. You may have seen other people who teach Neural Networks derive the gradient in huge and, frankly, scary and confusing mathematical equations (if you’re not well-versed in maths). But it’s unnecessary. I’ve written plenty of Neural Nets code and I rarely have to do mathematical derivation longer than two lines, and 95% of the time it can be done without writing anything at all. That is because we will only ever derive the gradient for very small and simple expressions (think of it as the base case) and then I will show you how we can compose these very simply with chain rule to evaluate the full gradient (think inductive/recursive case).\n",

    "\n",
    "If you remember your product rules, power rules, quotient rules, etc. (see e.g. derivative rules or wiki page), it’s very easy to write down the derivitative with respect to both $x$ and $y$ for a small expression such as $x * y$. But suppose you don’t remember your calculus rules. We can go back to the definition. For example, here’s the expression for the derivative w.r.t $x$:\n",

We tweaked x to x+h and calculated x_derivative = 3.0, which exactly happens to be the value of y in that example. It turns out that wasn’t a coincidence at all because that’s just what the analytic gradient tells us the x derivative should be for f(x,y) = x * y. The derivative with respect to y, by the way, turns out to be x, unsurprisingly by symmetry. So there is no need for any tweaking!

    "Looks like that worked! Lets now try to interpret intuitively what just happened. The circuit wants to output higher values. The last gate saw inputs `q = 3, z = -4` and computed output `-12`. \"Pulling\" upwards on this output value induced a force on both `q` and `z`: To increase the output value, the circuit \"wants\" `z` to increase, as can be seen by the positive value of the derivative(`der_f_wrt_z = +3`). Again, the size of this derivative can be interpreted as the magnitude of the force. On the other hand, q felt a stronger and downward force, since `der_f_wrt_q = -4`. In other words the circuit wants `q` to decrease, with a force of `4`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we get to the second, + gate which outputs q. By default, the + gate computes its derivatives which tells us how to change `x` and `y` to make `q` higher. BUT! Here is the crucial point: the gradient on q was computed as negative (`der_f_wrt_q = -4`), so the circuit wants q to decrease, and with a force of 4! So if the + gate wants to contribute to making the final output value larger, it needs to listen to the gradient signal coming from the top. In this particular case, it needs to apply tugs on `x, y` opposite of what it would normally apply, and with a force of `4`, so to speak. The multiplication by `-4` seen in the chain rule achieves exactly this: instead of applying a positive force of `+1` on both `x` and `y` (the local derivative), the full circuit’s gradient on both `x` and `y` becomes ` 1 x -4 = -4`. This makes sense: the circuit wants both `x` and `y` to get smaller because this will make `q` smaller, which in turn will make `f` larger.\n",
    "\n",
    "> If this makes sense, you understand backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets recap once again what we learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the previous chapter we saw that in the case of a single gate (or a single expression), we can derive the analytic gradient using simple calculus. We interpreted the gradient as a force, or a tug on the inputs that pulls them in a direction which would make this gate’s output higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In case of multiple gates everything stays pretty much the same way: every gate is hanging out by itself completely unaware of the circuit it is embedded in. Some inputs come in and the gate computes its output and the derivate with respect to the inputs. The only difference now is that suddenly, something can pull on this gate from above. That’s the gradient of the final circuit output value with respect to the ouput this gate computed. It is the circuit asking the gate to output higher or lower numbers, and with some force. The gate simply takes this force and multiplies it to all the forces it computed for its inputs before (chain rule). This has the desired effect:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. If a gate experiences a strong positive pull from above, it will also pull harder on its own inputs, scaled by the force it is experiencing from above\n",
    "    2. And if it experiences a negative tug, this means that circuit wants its value to decrease not increase, so it will flip the force of the pull on its inputs to make its own output value smaller.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A nice picture to have in mind is that as we pull on the circuit’s output value at the end, this induces pulls downward through the entire circuit, all the way down to the inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Isn’t it beautiful? The only difference between the case of a single gate and multiple interacting gates that compute arbitrarily complex expressions is this additional multipy operation that now happens in each gate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Patterns in the “backward” flow\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets look again at our example circuit with the numbers filled in. The first circuit shows the raw values, and the second circuit shows the gradients that flow back to the inputs as discussed. Notice that the gradient always starts off with +1 at the end to start off the chain. This is the (default) pull on the circuit to have its value increased.\n",
    "![](grad_vals.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "After a while you start to notice patterns in how the gradients flow backward in the circuits. For example, the `+` gate always takes the gradient on top and simply passes it on to all of its inputs (notice the example with `-4` simply passed on to both of the inputs of `+` gate). This is because its own derivative for the inputs is just `+1`, regardless of what the actual values of the inputs are, so in the chain rule, the gradient from above is just multiplied by `1` and stays the same. Similar intuitions apply to, for example, a `max(x,y)` gate. Since the gradient of `max(x,y)` with respect to its input is `+1` for whichever one of `x, y` is larger and 0 for the other, this gate is during backprop effectively just a gradient \"switch\": it will take the gradient from above and \"route\" it to the input that had a higher value during the forward pass.\n",
    "\n",

    "In the previous section you hopefully got the basic intuition behind backpropagation. Lets now look at an even more complicated and borderline practical example. We will consider a 2-dimensional neuron that computes the following function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x,y,a,b,c) = \\sigma(ax + by + c)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this expression, σ is the sigmoid function. Its best thought of as a “squashing function”, because it takes the input and squashes it to be between zero and one: Very negative values are squashed towards zero and positive values get squashed towards one. For example, we have `sig(-5) = 0.006, sig(0) = 0.5, sig(5) = 0.993`. Sigmoid function is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient with respect to its single input, as you can check on Wikipedia or derive yourself if you know some calculus is given by this expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial\\sigma(x)}{\\partial x} = \\sigma(x) (1-\\sigma(x))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the input to the sigmoid gate is x = 3, the gate will compute output f = 1.0 / (1.0 + Math.exp(-x)) = 0.95, and then the (local) gradient on its input will simply be dx = (0.95) * (1 - 0.95) = 0.0475.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s all we need to use this gate: we know how to take an input and forward it through the sigmoid gate, and we also have the expression for the gradient with respect to its input, so we can also backprop through it. Another thing to note is that technically, the sigmoid function is made up of an entire series of gates in a line that compute more atomic functions: an exponentiation gate, an addition gate and a division gate. Treating it so would work perfectly fine but for this example I chose to collapse all of these gates into a single gate that just computes sigmoid in one shot, because the gradient expression turns out to be simple.\n",
    "\n",

Also note that we are using `+=` to add onto the gradient in the backward function.

In the end we can discard the dataset and use the learned parameters to predict labels for previously unseen vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Training protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "We will eventually build up to entire neural networks and complex expressions, but lets start out simple and train a linear classifier very similar to the single neuron we saw at the end of Chapter 1. The only difference is that we’ll get rid of the sigmoid because it makes things unnecessarily complicated (I only used it as an example in Chapter 1 because sigmoid neurons are historically popular but modern Neural Networks rarely, if ever, use sigmoid non-linearities). Anyway, lets use a simple linear function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x,y) = ax + by + c$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this expression we think of x and y as the inputs (the 2D vectors) and `a,b,c` as the parameters of the function that we will want to learn. For example, if `a = 1, b = -2, c = -1`, then the function will take the first datapoint (`[1.2, 0.7]`) and output `1 * 1.2 + (-2) * 0.7 + (-1) = -1.2`. Here is how the training will work:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We select a random datapoint and feed it through the circuit\n",
    "2. We will interpret the output of the circuit as a confidence that the datapoint has class `+1`. (i.e. very high values = circuit is very certain datapoint has class `+1` and very low values = circuit is certain this datapoint has class `-1`.)\n",
    "3. We will measure how well the prediction aligns with the provided labels. Intuitively, for example, if a positive example scores very low, we will want to tug in the positive direction on the circuit, demanding that it should output higher value for this datapoint. Note that this is the case for the the first datapoint: it is labeled as `+1` but our predictor unction only assigns it value `-1.2`. We will therefore tug on the circuit in positive direction; We want the value to be higher.\n",
    "4. The circuit will take the tug and backpropagate it to compute tugs on the inputs `a,b,c,x,y`\n",
    "5. Since we think of `x,y` as (fixed) datapoints, we will ignore the pull on x,y. If you’re a fan of my physical analogies, think of these inputs as pegs, fixed in the ground.\n",
    "6. On the other hand, we will take the parameters `a,b,c` and make them respond to their tug (i.e. we’ll perform what we call a parameter update). This, of course, will make it so that the circuit will output a slightly higher score on this particular datapoint in the future.\n",
    "7. Iterate! Go back to step 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training scheme I described above, is commonly referred as Stochastic Gradient Descent. The interesting part I’d like to reiterate is that a,b,c,x,y are all made up of the same stuff as far as the circuit is concerned: They are inputs to the circuit and the circuit will tug on all of them in some direction. It doesn’t know the difference between parameters and datapoints. However, after the backward pass is complete we ignore all tugs on the datapoints (x,y) and keep swapping them in and out as we iterate over examples in the dataset. On the other hand, we keep the parameters (a,b,c) around and keep tugging on them every time we sample a datapoint. Over time, the pulls on these parameters will tune these values in such a way that the function outputs high scores for positive examples and low scores for negative examples.\n",

    "#### Learning a Support Vector Machine\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "At this point, if you’ve seen an explanation of SVMs you’re probably expecting me to define the SVM loss function and plunge into an explanation of slack variables, geometrical intuitions of large margins, kernels, duality, etc. But here, I’d like to take a different approach. Instead of definining loss functions, I would like to base the explanation on the force specification (I just made this term up by the way) of a Support Vector Machine, which I personally find much more intuitive. As we will see, talking about the force specification and the loss function are identical ways of seeing the same problem. Anyway, here it is:\n",
    "\n",
    "Support Vector Machine “Force Specification”:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If we feed a positive datapoint through the SVM circuit and the output value is less than `1`, pull on the circuit with force `+1`. This is a positive example so we want the score to be higher for it.\n",
    "* Conversely, if we feed a negative datapoint through the SVM and the output is greater than `-1`, then the circuit is giving this datapoint dangerously high score: Pull on the circuit downwards with force `-1`.\n",
    "* In addition to the pulls above, always add a small amount of pull on the parameters a,b (notice, not on c!) that pulls them towards zero. You can think of both `a,b` as being attached to a physical spring that is attached at zero. Just as with a physical spring, this will make the pull proprotional to the value of each of `a,b` (Hooke’s law in physics, anyone?). For example, if a becomes very high it will experience a strong pull of magnitude $|a|$ back towards zero. This pull is something we call regularization, and it ensures that neither of our parameters `a` or `b` gets disproportionally large. This would be undesirable because both `a,b` get multiplied to the input features `x,y` (remember the equation is `a*x + b*y + c`), so if either of them is too high, our classifier would be overly sensitive to these features. This isn’t a nice property because features can often be noisy in practice, so we want our classifier to change relatively smoothly if they wiggle around.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets quickly go through a small but concrete example. Suppose we start out with a random parameter setting, say, `a = 1, b = -2, c = -1`. Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If we feed the point `[1.2, 0.7]`, the SVM will compute score `1 * 1.2 + (-2) * 0.7 - 1 = -1.2`. This point is labeled as `+1` in the training data, so we want the score to be higher than `1`. The gradient on top of the circuit will thus be positive: `+1`, which will backpropagate to `a,b,c`. Additionally, there will also be a regularization pull on `a` of `-1` (to make it smaller) and regularization pull on `b` of `+2` to make it larger, toward zero.\n",
    "2. Suppose instead that we fed the datapoint `[-0.3, 0.5]` to the SVM. It computes `1 * (-0.3) + (-2) * 0.5 - 1 = -2.3`. The label for this point is `-1`, and since `-2.3` is smaller than `-1`, we see that according to our force specification the SVM should be happy: The computed score is very negative, consistent with the negative label of this example. There will be no pull at the end of the circuit (i.e it’s zero), since there no changes are necessary. However, there will still be the regularization pull on `a` of `-1` and on `b` of `+2`.\n",

    "Number of iterations needed. With this example data, with this example initialization, and with the setting of step size we used, it took about 300 iterations to train the SVM. In practice, this could be many more or many less depending on how hard or large the problem is, how you’re initializating, normalizing your data, what step size you’re using, and so on. This is just a toy demonstration, but later we will go over all the best practices for actually training these classifiers in practice. For example, it will turn out that the setting of the step size is very imporant and tricky. Small step size will make your model slow to train. Large step size will train faster, but if it is too large, it will make your classifier chaotically jump around and not converge to a good final result. We will eventually use witheld validation data to properly tune it to be just in the sweet spot for your particular data.\n",

    "Variable pull? A quick note to make at this point: You may have noticed that the pull is always 1,0, or -1. You could imagine doing other things, for example making this pull proportional to how bad the mistake was. This leads to a variation on the SVM that some people refer to as squared hinge loss SVM, for reasons that will later become clear. Depending on various features of your dataset, that may work better or worse. For example, if you have very bad outliers in your data, e.g. a negative data point that gets a score +100, its influence will be relatively minor on our classifier because we will only pull with force of -1 regardless of how bad the mistake was. In practice we refer to this property of a classifier as robustness to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets recap. We introduced the binary classification problem, where we are given N D-dimensional vectors and a label +1/-1 for each. We saw that we can combine these features with a set of parameters inside a real-valued circuit (such as a Support Vector Machine circuit in our example). Then, we can repeatedly pass our data through the circuit and each time tweak the parameters so that the circuit’s output value is consistent with the provided labels. The tweaking relied, crucially, on our ability to backpropagate gradients through the circuit. In the end, the final circuit can be used to predict values for unseen instances!\n",

Another way to think about it is that every one of the three hidden neurons is a linear classifier and now we’re putting an extra linear classifier on top of that. Now we’re starting to go deeper :).

The parameter update after backprop will ensure that when we see this particular example in the future, the network will be more likely to give us a value we desire, not the one it gave just before the update.\n",

Notice, this is a positive example so we want to the score to be greater than +1. 0.56 is not enough. And indeed, the expression for cost for this datapoint will compute: costi = Math.max(0, -1*0.56 + 1), which is 0.44. You can think of the cost as quantifying the SVM’s unhappiness.\n",

This isn’t looking very good: This score is very high for a negative example. It should be less than -1. Indeed, when we compute the cost: costi = Math.max(0, 1*0.37 + 1), we get 1.37. That’s a very high cost from this example, as it is being misclassified.\n",
    "* The last example xi = [3, 2.5] with label yi = 1 gives score 0.1*3 + 0.2*2.5 + 0.3, and that is 1.1. In this case, the SVM will compute costi = Math.max(0, -1*1.1 + 1), which is in fact zero. This datapoint is being classified correctly and there is no cost associated with it.\n",
